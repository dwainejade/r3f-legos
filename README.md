# LEGO Builder App - Development Outline

## App Overview

A 3D LEGO building application that allows users to create, save, and share LEGO constructions in an intuitive browser-based environment.

## Core Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Three.js (via @react-three/fiber)
- **3D Engine**: Three.js with @react-three/drei utilities
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useReducer)
- **Physics** (Advanced): @react-three/cannon or similar
- **File Handling**: Browser File APIs
- **Storage**: Local state (in-memory for Claude artifacts)

### Key Components

1. **3D Scene Manager** - Handles camera, lighting, rendering
2. **Brick System** - Core LEGO brick primitive with stud/anti-stud mechanics
3. **Inventory Panel** - Available brick types and colors
4. **Build Grid** - Snap-to-grid building surface
5. **Controls Manager** - Mouse/touch interactions for placing/removing bricks
6. **Save/Load System** - Project persistence and sharing

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (1-2 weeks)

Complete all **Basic Features** to have a working prototype where users can place, remove, and color basic LEGO bricks.

### Phase 2: MVP (2-4 weeks)

Add **MVP Features** to create a usable LEGO builder with save/load, proper snapping, and expanded brick library.

### Phase 3: Advanced (4-8 weeks)

Implement **Advanced Features** based on user feedback and priorities. Focus on the most requested features first.

### Phase 4: Polish & Scale (Ongoing)

Performance optimization, mobile support, and advanced professional tools.

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Brick Data Structure

```javascript
{
  id: "unique-id",
  type: "brick", // brick, plate, slope, technic
  dimensions: { width: 2, depth: 4, height: 1 },
  position: [x, y, z],
  rotation: 0, // 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees
  color: "#ff0000",
  connections: ["stud-id-1", "stud-id-2"] // connected studs
}
```

### Snapping Algorithm

1. Raycast from mouse position to find target surface
2. Convert world position to grid coordinates
3. Check for valid stud positions on target brick
4. Validate placement (no overlaps, proper support)
5. Snap new brick to nearest valid position

### Performance Considerations

- Use instanced rendering for repeated geometry (studs)
- Implement frustum culling for large builds
- Consider using simplified physics for stacking validation
- Optimize material sharing between similar bricks

## Success Metrics

- **Basic**: User can build simple structures (house, car)
- **MVP**: User can save/load projects and build complex models
- **Advanced**: User can create professional-quality builds with custom pieces and animations

Start with the Basic Features checklist and work your way up. Each tier builds upon the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation for your LEGO builder app!
