## Technical Implementation Notes

### Shape Data Structure

```javascript
{
  id: "unique-id",
  type: "rectangle", // rectangle, cylinder, sphere, cone, triangle, pyramid
  position: [x, y, z],
  rotation: [x, y, z], // Euler angles in radians
  scale: [x, y, z], // Non-uniform scaling
  dimensions: {
    // Shape-specific properties
    width: 2,
    height: 1,
    depth: 3,
    // For cylinders: radius, height, radialSegments
    // For spheres: radius, widthSegments, heightSegments
  },
  material: {
    color: "#ff0000",
    type: "standard", // basic, standard, physical
    roughness: 0.5,
    metalness: 0.0,
    opacity: 1.0
  },
  selected: false,
  visible: true
}
```

### Grid System

```javascript
const GRID_SIZES = [0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 5]; // Available grid spacings
const DEFAULT_GRID_SIZE = 1;

function snapToGrid(position, gridSize) {
  return [
    Math.round(position[0] / gridSize) * gridSize,
    Math.round(position[1] / gridSize) * gridSize,
    Math.round(position[2] / gridSize) * gridSize,
  ];
}
```

### Transform Handle System

- **Position**: XYZ arrow gizmos for movement
- **Scale**: Corner/edge handles for resizing
- **Rotation**: Ring gizmos around each axis
- **Unified**: Combined transform tool (like Blender)

### Performance Considerations

- Use instanced rendering for identical shapes
- Implement LOD for complex geometries
- Use simplified collision shapes for interaction
- Optimize material sharing between similar shapes
- Consider using workers for heavy calculations
